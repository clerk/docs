# Get started with Remix

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Remix support is still in beta and the APIs presented below are subject to change. Please report any feedback, issues, or ideas [to support](https://clerk.dev/support) - we'd love to hear from you!&#x20;

Clerk is the easiest way to add authentication and user management to your [Remix](https://remix.run) application. This guide will walk you through the necessary steps to install and use Clerk in a new Next.js application.

After following this guide, you should have a working Remix app complete with:&#x20;

* Fully fledged sign up and sign in flows.
* Social Login with the vendors of your choice (Google, Twitter, etc)
* Secure password or passwordless authentication.
* A prebuilt user profile page.

## Before you start

You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev). For more information, check out our [Setup your application](../popular-guides/setup-your-application.md) guide.

## Creating a new Remix app

If you haven't done so already, start by creating a new Remix application

```
npx create-remix@latest
```

For more information, you can reference the [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/tutorials/blog).

## Install @clerk/remix

Once you have a Remix app ready, you need to install the Clerk Remix SDK. This will give you access to our prebuilt Clerk Components and React hooks.

```
npm install @clerk/remix@next
```

Now, we need to retrieve your Backend API Key from the [API Keys page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=api-keys).

Remix allows developers to set environment variables by creating a `.env` file in their application root. Add Clerk's environment variables as follows:

```bash
# Replace [your-frontend-api] with the actual Frontend API key
echo "CLERK_FRONTEND_API=[your-frontend-api]" > .env
# Replace [your-backend-api-key] with the actual Backend API key
echo "CLERK_API_KEY=[your-backend-api-key]" > .env
```

Clerk is now installed, but still needs to be initialized.  We can go ahead and start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

## Initialize Clerk in app/root.tsx

In Remix, `app/root.tsx` wraps your entire application in both server and browser contexts. Clerk requires three modifications to this file so we can share the authentication state with your Remix routes.

### Set \`rootAuthLoader\`

First, we must define a root loader.

```javascript
import { rootAuthLoader } from "@clerk/remix/ssr.server";

export const loader: LoaderFunction = (args) => rootAuthLoader(args);
```

If you'd like to load additional data, you can pass your own loader directly to `rootAuthLoader`.

```javascript
import { rootAuthLoader } from "@clerk/remix/ssr.server";

export const loader: LoaderFunction = (args) =>
  rootAuthLoader(args, ({ params, request, context, auth }) => {
    // auth.userId will be set if there is a signed in user
    return { yourData: "here" };
  });
```

### Connect Clerk to React

Clerk provides a `ConnectClerk` helper to provide the authentication state to your React tree. This helper works with SSR out-of-the-box and follows the "higher-order component" paradigm.

First, update App so it is not exported as the default module:

```javascript
// Remove "export default" from in front of `function App() {`
function App() {
  ...
}
```

Then, wrap `App` with `ConnectClerk` and pass in your `frontendApi` variable from your instance dashboard:

```javascript
import { ConnectClerk } from "@clerk/remix";

export default ConnectClerk(App);
```

### Connect Clerk to the Catch Boundary

Clerk uses Remix's catch boundary to refresh expired authentication tokens.

```java
import { ConnectClerkCatchBoundary } from "@clerk/remix";

export const CatchBoundary = ConnectClerkCatchBoundary();
```

You can add your own boundary simply by passing it as an argument.

```jsx
export const CatchBoundary = ConnectClerkCatchBoundary(YourBoundary);
```

That's everything! The rest of your application can now leverage authentication as needed.

## Using authentication state

Now that your `root.tsx` is configured, you can use the user's authentication information anywhere in your application.

### In loaders and actions

Use the `getAuth` helper to retrieve the user ID and session ID from a loader or action. Most commonly, developers only require the user ID, while the session ID my be helpful auditing use cases.

```javascript
import { getAuth } from "@clerk/remix/ssr.server";

export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const { userId, sessionId } = await getAuth(request);
  
  // Your loader here
}
```

### In React

In React, the same information is available via the `useAuth` hook:

```javascript
import { useAuth } from "@clerk/remix";

const { userId, sessionId } = useAuth();
```

A complete reference to our React helpers is [available here](broken-reference).

## Protecting routes

To protect a route from signed out users, simply add a redirect to your loader if no `userId` is found in the authentication state:

```jsx
export const loader: LoaderFunction = async ({ request }) => {
  const { userId, sessionId } = await getAuth(request);
  if(!auth.userId){
    return redirect("https://accounts.foo.bar.lcl.dev/sign-in");
  }
  // Your loader here
}
```
