### Authentication

The Clerk Backend API uses secret API keys. You can find and create your instance API keys in Clerk Dashboard **API Keys -> Backend API Keys** page.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
These keys should never be shared with anyone, as they allow the holder to access all your Clerk resources.
{% endhint %}

&#x20;An example request is the following:

```bash
curl \
-H "Authorization: Bearer test_abc...xyz" \
-H "Content-type: application/json" \
https://api.clerk.dev/v1/users
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Be careful not to expose these keys in your Git repository, frontend code, or anywhere else that is public.&#x20;
