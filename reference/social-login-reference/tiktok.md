# TikTok

## Overview

Adding social login with TikTok to your app with Clerk is simple -  you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.&#x20;

For production instances, you will need to create your own developer account with **TikTok** and generate your own Client ID and Client secret.

Your app needs to be reviewed by TikTok before the registration completes. Note that this might take a couple of days.

Once your app is approved, simply copy the **Client Key** and **Client Secret** from the TikTok panel, go back to the Clerk dashboard, open the **Manage credentials** modal for the TikTok provider and and paste them into the respective fields.
