# Discord

## Overview

Adding social login with Discord to your app with Clerk is simple -  you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.&#x20;

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your Discord account.

## Before you start

* You need to create a Clerk Application in your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev). For more information, check out our [Setup your application](../../popular-guides/setup-your-application.md) guide.
* You need to have a Discord account. To create one, [click here](https://discord.com/register).

## Configuring Discord social login

First, you need to register a new OAuth Discord app at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Set a name for your new application and click create. Now that your application has been created, from the left side panel click on **OAuth2**, this is where you also need to add your **Redirect URL.** Go to the [Social Login page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) and enable Discord. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Paste the value into the **Redirect** input and save the changes.

Once all the above are complete, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.
