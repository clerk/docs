## Overview

Adding social login with Google to your app with Clerk is simple -  you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.&#x20;

For production instances, you will need to create your own developer account with **Google** and generate your own Client ID and Client secret.

Go to the [Social Login page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) and enable Google.  In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and paste the values you obtained during the previous step.

Before you close the modal, copy the **Authorized redirect URI.** Add it to the Google console dashboard by creating a new **Authorized redirect URI** as shown in the screenshot above.&#x20;

Don't forget to click **Apply** in the Clerk dashboard. Social login with Google is now configured ðŸ”¥&#x20;
