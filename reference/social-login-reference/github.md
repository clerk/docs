## Overview

Adding social login with GitHub to your app with Clerk is simple -  you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.&#x20;

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your GitHub account.

Go to the [Social Login page](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/last-active?path=authentication/social) and enable GitHub. In the modal that opened, ensure **Use custom credentials** is enabled and copy **Authorized redirect URI**. Go back to the GitHub panel, paste the value into the **Authorization callback URL** field and complete the registration.

Once registration is complete, you'll get redirected to project's admin panel. Click the **Generate a new client secret** button to get your new client secret. Then, copy the **Client ID** and **Client secret.** Go back to the Clerk Dashboard and paste them into the respective fields.
