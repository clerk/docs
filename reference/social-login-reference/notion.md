# Notion

## Overview

Adding social login with Notion to your app with Clerk is simple -  you only need to set the **Client ID**, **Client Secret** and **Authorized redirect URI** in your instance settings.

To make the development flow as smooth as possible, Clerk uses preconfigured shared OAuth credentials and redirect URIs for development instances - no other configuration is needed.&#x20;

For production instances, you will need to generate your own Client ID and Client secret using your LinkedIn account.

The purpose of this guide is to help you create a Notion developer account and a Notion OAuth app - if you're looking for step-by-step instructions using Clerk to add social login (OAuth) to your application, follow the [Social login (OAuth)](../../popular-guides/social-login-oauth.md) guide.
